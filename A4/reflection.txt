## Verification questions

Please use the `RpnParser` program to answer these questions:

1. How many operations are required to evaluate this expression for the surface area of a dodecahedron?
   `3 25 10 5 sqrt() * + sqrt() * edges 2 ^ *`

   Answer: 7

2. How many operations are required to evaluate the optimized form of that expression?

   Answer: 2

## Reflection questions

1. What part of the assignment did you find the trickiest to understand or get working?
   Was there a particular insight or diagnostic technique that lead to a breakthrough?

   Answer: We had the most trouble understanding how to have the exceptions `IncompleteRpnException` and
   `UndefinedFunctionException` incorporated in RpnParser. We considered edge cases through hypothetically working out
   certain problems on paper in order to incorporate those exceptions.
